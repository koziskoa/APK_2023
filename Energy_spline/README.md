# Line displacement application
## About
This application takes two input lines (a modifiable line and a barrier) and performs displacement of the modifiable line for the purposes of cartographic generalization.

## How to Use
### Input files
This application only supports  `CSV` file format.

This application only supports layers in `S-JTSK / Krovak East North (EPSG:5514)` coordinate system. Two sample lines (a road and a river) are provided in the `input_files/.` folder.

Make sure to have all the `.py` files in the same directory.

Launch the application by running `mainform.py`.
